# A real case analysis for a electronics shop company in the US

A sales case by Keith Galli [link](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks)

Here I answered four key questions: 

- What was the best month for sales? how much was earned that month?
- What city had the highest number of sales?
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying products?
- What products sold the most?
