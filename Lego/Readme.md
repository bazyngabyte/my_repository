# A datacamp project to analyze one of most famous licensed Lego sets, the star wars series.

You can consult the datacamp porject [here](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/10)

Here I answered four key questions: 

- What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?
- Which is the most popular Star Wars Licensed theme (In terms of number of sets released)?
- Which is the total of licensed Parent Themes of Star Wars released by year and how it behaved?
- In which year was Star Wars the most popular licensed theme (In terms of number of sets released that year)?
