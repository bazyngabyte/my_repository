      "When the S24 Ultra shipped with its 7 years support and real AI that I use all the time, I felt at that moment that Apple was WAY behind.  Then when I saw Cook and his engineering guy responding with a smirk responding to press a press interview by a no-name reporter, asking them the questions that was on their user's mimds about what Apple's response would be.  They played the secret game as we cannot tell you much now and how it would revolutiomary and obsolete what is out there..  Then how IOS 18 was on track.  Then it ships about when they said it would, without capabilities that Android has had for almost a decade, and no AI.  He can say from ground-up, but what does that mean?  The chipsets used by Samsung has had an architecture for AI for the past two revisions, and a lot of the features they say will be available for the previous two flagship models.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The kingpin that locks people into the Apple propretary environment is the iPhone.  Apple had a trust issue in the spring with some still trusting Apple to deliver being best at AI with IOS 18.  Apple is in no position to lock anyone into anything proprietry anymore.  Without the technology they are no longer a top-tier phone.  Apple spent a lot of money in a hurry on AI, but Samsung and Google have been working on it for years.  If they couldn't pull it off, they should have at least partnered with Microsoft.  Microsoft AI is well down in about 3rd-place, but they could have made a show at least.  Those who waited for 18 with great anticipation are feeling they've been made a fool of.  The Samsung release was just the opposite.  Everyone expected an incremental update until it released and revolutionized people's expectations, thereby raising the bar exponentially.  The S24 Ultra gets upgrades in AI functionality every few weeks, and has since March and Apple still has nothing to show.  Now that 18 shipped without it, I don't see why people would buy an iPhone unless they ship capabilities that maintains its relevancy in an environment that has undergone and sizemic shift in capabilities and user expecations.  I agree with the video.  Don't figure them shipping \"real soon\".  It has to justify itself on what it is today because you don't know if it will be anywhere near what Samsung and Android has even when it does ship.  Even the Pixel released productive AI a year ago.  Apple has a problem.\n",

Sorry I can‚Äôt get past the 50/50 split. People complain Apple Google and Microsoft take 30% but Marques greed is off the charts.  The second reason I don‚Äôt support this app is during setup it asks you what type of photos you like for it to suggest photos for you. But NONE of the images that you choose for suggestions are downloadable without spending $50 a year or part of an image pack.   Instead of charging 7.99 for a pack of images why not sell a singular image for like $2.99 or even $4.99.  This is a new app and hope first Marques get of his greedy horse and stop trying to command 50% commission.\n",

      "424. I think it's great to support artists with this project...even though 50/50 sounds kinda lame...when all people are interested in are the images not the app. If you think about it... it's just a more filtered deviantart/artstation/cara platform to explore artists. So making it a weird subscription thing...feels kinda off. Artists defenitely need support and I love that, somehow this ain't it. Somehow, this still feels exploitative for both users and the artists.\n",

It funny how all these phones that come out are truly revolutionary with amazing technology that I do think is pretty great, but yet they haven't figured out how to make them no slip out if your hands.. yeah I get its a money grab, but you'd think that these companies that make billions in sales woukd include a non slip case/or make them non slip. We are humans that tend to drop things. Having a 2200 dollar or move device in your hands thats made of material thats destined to slip out of your hands tells me that more money is needed to be spent to protect a expensive device that should already be protected. I recently bought a s24 ultra, the thing is more slippery then soap (exaggeration, making a point)  and know without a case its done for. I'm not a clumsy guy, but am human and know holding something this smooth will be dropped. Apple, Samsung are both technical achievements, but share the same money grab accessories needs. I get its a business, but everything seems to be about money.. add a cheap no slip case, or make them non slip ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n",

      "566. I started using iPhone 4 & 5 and switched to Huawei P phones series to series long ago. Then US sanctioned China and all hell broke loose, I couldn't find a suitable phone and didn't like Samsung. I reluctantly changed back to iPhone 14 Pro. It was decent phones wt good OS but I use my phone less as it is less functional and more for the looks, the brand and the stability. After transitioning back to iPhone I was constantly on a look out for better functional phone and was earlier looking at Motorola Razr and Samsung Z flip. I also checked out Xiaomi and Vivo phones but end up continuing wt my iPhone. Since the Honor V3 launched, I have been visiting their both regularly as changing phones frm apple to android is very challenging for anyone like me but there is a high chances I will be getting the Honor Magic V3. I like its versatility, its functions and practicality. I see myself fully immerse and fully utilising my phone for surprise presentations, as a workhorse, multi tasking, quick buttons and the freedom of use. iPhone is the opposite of all these. Pls do not get me wrong I do not hate iPhones, my other devices include MacBook Pro but for phone comparison, I think iPhone is only good to look at, status and its  a really boring phone, few years using it and I only use it for calls, whatssapp, other softwares are tedious example whenever I open safari and search location it ask my permission, WhatsApp location sometimes mixed wt google maps & Apple Maps, it also has a longer process when using apps, searching and others. I missed my Huawei P phones or androids and I cant wait to change to Honor V3. I hope I am able to fully use all its functions and work as a work horse instead of a useless pretencious gimmicky phone again. Thank you.\n",

Even the free download is 1 30 second ad and you get a 1080P HD version of the photo, and again that ad revenue is going to the artist you just downloaded from. The $15 a month subscription is just there to upsell you to the $60 a year subscription because that‚Äôs more profit for them and unlimited photos for you (win win) and that‚Äôs way cheaper than any hundred dollar plus subscription for Netflix Disney+, etc., etc. I get they‚Äôre just photos but even Spotify is $120 a year ‚Äúand that‚Äôs just music.‚Äù For someone who likes to change their wallpaper (and phones) frequently.

However, $50/per year or $11.99/per month for a wallpaper app is actually wild. The average streaming service is priced at around the same monthly amount depending on the plan you choose, and you are getting so much more value out of a Hulu or Netflix subscription so the pricing for those subscription services actually seems fair. But for a wallpaper app? There's just not that much value in that as a service. I understand these things cost money and it's admirable to share revenue/profits with the artists who contribute 50/50, but dang dude that pricing seems WAAAAY off and steep. Sheesh!\n",

This is a good time for him to maybe lean more into his mass audience. Launching a niche app on one of most viewed video of the year was a terrible idea. This was probably a waveform or X launch worthy. Most of us don't care about wallpapers but maybe there's an audience out there paying for premium wallpapers and this is exactly what they were looking for.\n",

But clearly there are people who do value wallpapers and screen savers. People are so upset about the price, but you can watch an ad then get a wallpaper for free. We live in a time where artists are struggling to be paid for their work. How would these artists be paid if there were no ads and their work was offered for free? If you don‚Äôt want to pay for the wallpaper you like, you don‚Äôt have to, but someone people still found a way to complain about that. Then people are complaining about the permissions, but you can reject every single permission, and you don‚Äôt have to even sign in. How do you complain where you don‚Äôt have to sign up or sign in and you can reject every single permission? 99% of these complaints are not justifiable. You can say he should give the artists more than 50%, but most artists are only paid a flat fee, which is going to be much much lower.

You can download most of the wallpapers for free, and I did download a couple I liked for free by watching ads. Everything on there seems to be unique and custom made by the few select artists they have on there. Which unfortunately licensing custom made images is more expensive than AI generated images or royalty free images you can find online. The price is high for wallpapers sure, but it seems to be directed at a more niche audience. Most people set their wallpaper once and rarely ever change it, but there are people out there who like changing up their wallpaper a lot to make their phone feel fresh and new.

It's the worst iPhone release in years (based on the demand for pre-orders) and nobody that has made a hands on or review  can hide  the struggle to make it seem interesting. It's not. Even those who are technically savvy agree that the new fantastic camera button is too complicated to use. Takes me to when iPhones had  a pressure sensitive display , amazing technology that nobody really cared to use.\n",

You and your crew did nothing wrong by creating a niche product. From my experience in a start up, I would bet the pricing, while, frankly, laughably high, is not remotely malicious or greedy.

Why they believe if u purchase the Pro the color is too much? Most people slap a case anyways so why not leave that choice up to us to make instead of yr over yr same colors for the pro models.

Hell, if I want to get fancy, I already have Wallpaper Engine; I had it for years! You're running a tech channel, we're not babies, Marques, we can source wallpapers on our own. Wrong target audience, wrong idea, wrong implementation, too high pricing, the very idea of having a subscription is so dumb... Did you do ANY market research? But I downloaded this and can I tell you why this won't take off? We're a community of tech lovers, some of the things we appreciate are video games (no video game wallpapers on the app), we're geeks and nerds (no comic book, anime, manga, TV show, movie or cartoon wallpapers on the app), some of us like to add some spice to our devices (no nudity of any kind on the app, artistic, erotic or straight up porn, nothing there), one of the things I really like and use since the first Android device I bought was animated wallpapers (no animated wallpapers on the app) - do you see where I'm going here? It's not that your app is a niche product, it's a product without a niche. It's an artsy-fartsy, subscription-based app that competes with Wallpaper Engine and basic image search...\n",
      "2760. it's not weird at all. apple stock was in grave danger of having mass exodus. they're afraid that if people leave, it'll be hard to get them back. berkshire hathaway already dumped a big portion and everyone was doubting apple could pull off anything innovative. they basically didn't so they lied and said ai was coming but they put it in the 16 right now. the stuff apple is talking about is extremely difficult to implement and literally nobody has been successful with it so far on a handheld device. the constant need to increase revenue is killing great companies. if jobs was alive, he would've seen ai coming a mile away. cook didnt even jump until the water got to his neck.\n",

He could have shown it to any of his friends or a random person on street and they'd have told him how bad of a idea it is. It doesn't make any sense. Reallllyy stupid move for someone this smart.

It's pushing a corporate agenda and the org's political views purely for the purpose of getting more eyes on the product (i.e., weaponized subliminal advertising) while pretending that it is for supporting said political view - exactly the kind of subtle thing Apple would do, and several other companies have been doing. It's patently obvious once you start noticing it.\n",
      "2861. So a lot ppl in the comments glossed over the free version that was offered lol.\n",
      "2862. I got my 16 Pro this year (Upgrade from 12 Pro). I love love the x5 telephoto and the slightly bigger display. However, that camera button? ANNOYING af. I disabled it completely from the very beginning.

      "2877. It's's quite odd to see MKB boasting about his w wallpaper app while essentially destroying two companies that were trying to bring something innovative to the tech industry. A 10 year old today could probably create an app like that. It was so unreasonable of him to be so critical of a first-generation product. He should be more mindful of the impact his words can have, especially when evaluating something that has genuine potential.\n",

      "2884. I'm think about switching to iphone 16 pro from my S22 ultra. I've never been an iphone user. Is the new one good enough for the switch or should I go for the older models?\n",

      "2890. I've been an Apple brand fan for years perhaps decades. However, as an Apple brand consumer I'm getting fed up with Apple not truly being innovative and continuing to sell the same phone over and over again.. decided to try a Google Pixel 9 PRO XL. I'm not a huge fan of the Android OS but I'm getting the hang of it. I feel that many will be jumping ship\n",

      "2896. I have a Pixel user since the Pixel 3 dropped. Always going for Pro versions if available. I was slightly tired of the hiccups of android, so bought the iPhone 16 Pro. I am quite happy with the phone and stability of the system - and obviously I find things I liked better about Android and some better on iOS. When you do these reviews, I feel like you're missing to pick up the people who tune in from Android Systems who are looking to change. Nevertheless, always appreciate the straight up and honest opinions.\n",

      "2900. For clarity: The free version only provides standard-definition wallpapers, requires you to watch ads, and demands access and permissions. If someone offers a subscription with vague future promises, don't buy into it (as MKBHD advises). Offering an artist 50% of the revenue is like going through a messy divorce after being cheated on but still giving them the better deal. \n",

There's no free version of Panels for high quality wallpapers. The free version makes you watch two ads so you can download a shitty SD version of the wallpaper. This greedy action was very sell-out-ish\n",

      "2912. Seriously don't understand the critics for panels app, if its successful the digital artists have a good platform to sell their contents, its not much different from any online services... obviously most of the users are gonna be free content users on the off chance someone wants high res download they can just have a month sub to download needed wallpaper...people cringing as if they r already paying 50$ ughhh!!! Yes I'm never gonna pay it, but wont crib on a platform which digital artists can use to sell their stuff, I have seen a few digital artists and its not easy creating high res digital art....\n",
      "2913. As much as I love and appreciate your channel, and your general ideas about technology and software..I think you really missed the mark on your wallpaper app. $50 a year for that is something only Apple could do. It's a bit insulting to your followers and fans, and feels like you're milking them more than giving them something. Not a good look for you buddy.\n",

      "2915. Where is even Huawei mate tripple fold video?\n",
      "2916. I guess Marques probably thought he could launch the app in one of his most popular videos (iPhone videos are always popular!). Who knew it would backfire spectacularly?\n",
      "2917. It‚Äôs time iPhone drops the annual release and maybe gives a worthwhile phone thats ready to ship maybe every two years.\n",
      "2918. Idk if it‚Äôs true about other places, but on the balkans Siri doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve lost all her functionality that was available simply through an update. I‚Äôm using an iPhone 14. Wtf Apple?\n",

      "silly imo but not as bad as people are making it seem to be. BUT that can change under 3 conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Some of the images are AI generated. In that case this shit is a scam\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The wallpapers can be found elsewhere for free. Why would I pay money for the app if the wallpapers can be gotten off Google images or something. Again, a scam if that‚Äôs the case\n",

      "3. The selection of wallpapers would need to be HUGE to make it worth the money, with all being good quality and having a large variety\n",
      "2936. Samsung been had the action button for the camera. Also the lighting animation around the edge samsung had for years. Its sad people still waste their money on iphones. Apple users need to demand lower prices for lack of features and innovations.\n",
      "2937. you've lost your way, Marques, if you think that promoting a $50-a-year wallpaper app is a good idea\n",

      "1) Pay per wallpaper: A subscription puts pressure on you to curate good quality wallpapers (if a person doesn't like the collection your app offers they are gonna wonder why they are paying $50 to you). A $1 or $2 fee per wallpaper puts the pressure on the artists to create good quality wallpapers.\n",
      "2) The free tier: Watching ads to download the SD version is crazy. If it doesn't make sense to provide the HD version from a monetary perspective, increase the number of ads you need to watch to unlock the wallpaper (you pay the wallpaper's worth through your time or through your money)\n",
      "3) Subscription: Sure, keep the subscription. Die hard fans won't mind paying yearly to support you, or maybe just to reduce the hassle of having to pay EVERY time you want to download a wallpaper\n",

      "3052. Can you half press to focus using the camera button?\n",
      "3053. He definitely got paid for this review\n",
      "3054. You became the one thing you swore to destroy.\n",
      "3055. @mkbhd why is the panels app under developer‚Äôs account, instead of your own. That may cause issues as the user base grows. Do check please üôè\n",

      "3061. If it looks like a button, feels like a button, acts like a button, and is pressed like a button, trust me, Bro, It's a MF button\n",
      "3062. Never would I think to see the day that there would be such a disconnect between MKBHD and his audience. The whole reason why I liked you so much was because I felt like I could trust you. I‚Äôm not so sure of it now.\n",
      "3063. I bet someone at Apple is cringing every time Marques says ‚Äúbutton‚Äù üòÇ\n",
      "3064. So the wobble coming from the camera lenses sticking out past the body üòÇ\n",
      "3065. My brother in Christ, I honestly thought one day you would build a phone with the design of Google, the UI of Samsung, the processor of an iPhone with 7 years of software-security updates and 100% repair rights, mass-produced from India.\n",

      "3067. Take your garbage app and do a review about that. Be very hyper critical and over the top consumer biased when reviewing your garbage app. Look at its predatory 50% commission policy or invasive controls that app has or no work done towards security. If you don't do that, your reputation will forever be lost.\n",
      "3068. iPhone 16 is already bad, you do not have to top it up with your 50$ wallpaper app.\n",

      "3072. Worst Wallpaper app. The walls firstly are not that great. Secondly it's $50 subscription. If you don't take subscription then watch 2 ads for only a low pixel wallpaper. What a Apple type product is this from MKBHD. You're expected to bring something innovative being in the industry for so long and you bring garbage to us.\n",
      "3073. What you did was profoundly hubristic and foolish. This is the last time I'll ever come here for a product review because that's clearly no longer a service you are interested in providing. You're probably struggling to find new ways to grow your revenue. Sadly, this wasn't a very smart way to try and solve that problem.\n",
      "3074. The iPhone 16 Pro is more a 15 Pro S ‚Äì but to remember the \"S\"-Models were the best iPhone models üòâ\n",
      "3075. No single word about those ai smart microphones for audio in recorded videos??\n",
      "Shame on youü•≤\n",
      "3076. 60hz in 2024 really is criminal\n",
      "3077. Is there anyone who use their wallpaper for at least 4 years? Yes, it's me Lol.\n",
      "3078. The worst iPhone ever same old sheet\n",
      "3079. It's not ok to nickel and dime your fans. People are losing trust. I worry you've peaked.\n",
      "3080. Knew he was a crook when he was face to face to with Apple and never called him out.\n",
      "3081. That's hilarious! I wish I could've been there to hear the suggestion to put $50 üòÇüòÇüòÇ greedy much?\n",
      "3082. I came to the comment section to say this is the reason I switched to Pixel 8 instead of getting the new IPhone 16 Pro, yes I downloaded Graded cause I‚Äôm tired of Apple not doing nothing innovated since the IPhone 8 but damn these comments about a subscription are just‚Ä¶.  üë®‚Äçüç≥ üòò\n",

      "3087. nice wrist band\n",
      "3088. Anyone who actually paid for a wallpaper app, should be stripped of all their money since they aren‚Äôt good in making decisions. $12 a month lol. People ask where do you get these wallpapers? Dumb people that can‚Äôt figure out how to do 2 min google to get the walls they want. Pffft. This app should have never happed dude ü§¶\n",
      "3089. I think this new phones have features required by  √†rmy and government and nobody knows what they can do. The rest is useless crap. Wallpapers üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n",
      "3090. Tbh, I‚Äôd be one to look for a wallpaper app. I change photos every so often. Even spent time to customize my app icons. Would be a nice expansion if that was included too. Free version looks good so far. If not for you, don‚Äôt download it\n",
      "3091. They are back to making good product.\n",
      "I feel happy\n",
      "3092. It's good people are blasting this guy for this useless app, I just wished people had done the same when he, with the insane reach he has on YouTube and social media, refused to cover and inform people about the massive invasion to privacy with the on-device scanning that Apple planned some years ago (maybe they did it anyway and we never knew)\n",
      "3093. anybody know the weather app he used?\n",
      "3094. $50 y/o is something 99% of you can easily afford. But I think the mistake he made with this announcement is failing to give any details about those future updates - which may have given many folks some incentive to invest into or support this app. Right now it's just looking like an overpriced Zedge\n",
      "3095. Nice amigo!!\n",
      "3096. Its great to see how everyone finally realizes that you are shill for all the big corporations, do lazy reviews with no research and have sold out.  I love it.\n",

      "3099. That app is so out of touch. It's disappointing to see such potential wasted. With your reach and ressources, this app could have been so much more.\n",
      "3100. How can someone so tech savvy and genuinely intelligent to be so out of touch with reality? This panels app has by far one of the most ridiculous pricing models I have ever seen on iOS ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n",
      "3101. Just charge one dollar for each wallpaper. Simple.\n",
      "3102. Even the iphone getting critics will still sell like crazy, welcome to the other side. They'll still use your wallpapers, just make another video on that much later, allow this video to make you more money and not get into your head, a comment doesn't define you. Much love brother man, I trust that you'll find ways to win us on your wallpaper app, the comment section will have your answers on what people like and dislike about it (Times Have Changed).\n",

      "3107. Only 50/50?!  Oh my poor artists.\n",
      "3108. 1. The 45W charging speed is almost a false claim. In actual use cases it barely reaches 32W.\n",
      "2. Lots of people love the 3X telephoto lens, which wasn‚Äôt mentioned in this video\n",
      "3. The camera control button is a bit too stiff, and when you press it down, it could often result in a slight shake, which then leads to a blurry picture\n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly can‚Äôt believe how shallow this review video is. Marques didn‚Äôt talk about any of those things, which are crucial factors in daily-using these new iPhones as normal users.\n",
      "3109. Dont you guys have iphone16\n",
      "3110. Don't even promise marques, because in the current state, This app is going to be buried 10 feet under other already popular, awesome and free wallpaper apps.\n",
      "3111. Brass is free and 30x better\n",
      "3112. This entire app fiasco just shows how out of touch Marques is with the average person. Guess that's what having Youtube money does.\n",
      "3113. The wallpaper app is a... promise? üòÖüòÖ\n",
      "3114. I have 14 Pro 6'1 and I have small hands...16 Pro being 6'3 is gonna be a big hurdle for me. I don't like that upsize of 16 pro lol.\n",
      "3115. This guy start getting weird,  you guys saw the pillow on his left with gay and proud flag?    He is wired ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..\n",
      "3116. I installed the app after seeing Marques getting roasted. Here's my thoughts. \n",
      "Bro ‚Ç¨6.99 for a collection of 4 wallpapers? What are you smoking? I didn't even check the subscription after that. You're very much out of touch with reality. You are in the elite rich class and just taking a subway ride in NYC will not humble you. You'll have to do more to know what life is like at the ground floor and then you'll realise the money you're asking just for a freaking wallpaper is bonkers.\n",
      "3117. I'm sure the Panels app will add more features in the future to justify the $50/yr subscription. Because he knows the space. Because if he doesn't, he's the most out of touch tech reviewer out there. Which he isn't. But he definitely messed up the announcement timing. Shouldn't have announced a subscription fee for what is a wallpaper app right now. It's like somebody said, in tech you never buy a product on the promise of future upgrades. Only what is available right now.\n",
      "3118. At least when Samsung launched the S24 series, the AI features didn't feel like an unfinished product. It's just been getting better with updates. Apple is a little late to the party. Honestly, that camera button seems like a gimmick to me. Yes, I've seen it in person. And I'm sure Apple is saving 8k video for the iPhone 17 or 18, just to say that they're putting something \"revolutionary\" since clearly they've been running out of ideas to the point that adding new buttons is revolutionary to them.\n",
      "3119. 50/50?\n",
      "3120. you should open a tequila company bro\n",
      "3121. Make the camera button able to control screen brightness or hue of the screen\n",
      "3122. Hold up. Wasn‚Äôt this guy talking about taking a break? What, did you take the afternoon off? I guess that‚Äôs the time you took to shill your crappy wallpaper app. That‚Äôs right , a wallpaper app in the year 2024. Subscription service to boot. I‚Äôm over this guy.\n",
      "3123. $50/year for wallpaper, good luck with that\n",
      "3124. The comment section really shows me why i never pursue my dream in graphic design, mkbhd out here not getting a cash grab, download the app. Its creator first. Shows who the artist is and reconizing an artist that otherwise would never get the audience. But when everyone so conditioned to google images. Why care about artists anymore.\n",
      "3125. Welcome to the other side Marques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing like that will get you shit even if the product was premium, worked and is something people really need. Some shitty PNGs most certainly isn't worth $50 in this economy.\n",

      "3128. This grifter has removed himself from the pedestal..his delusion peaked and gravity took over\n",

      "3134. You are a millionaire bro. You are asking for 50$ to support your app. Why you need any kinda support here? You could invest the money, grow your app to be worth 50$ and then start asking for it. You need to invest, not everything has to be crowd sourced.\n",
      "3135. Holy crap! AT&T ads are crazy annoying! We get it. They're sponsors. We'd like to see your content though, and not their ads.\n",

      "3139. This is The Worst Wallpaper App I've Ever Reviewed... For Now.\n",
      "3140. Hey bro, you should have the app be free to shop around & look at the high quality wallpapers. Then sell each wallpaper for .99 cents or something. I feel like all these people bagging on the $50/year would be more accepting to that idea. I hope the app works out for you bro\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Then whichever artist created the wallpaper that got purchased can get paid a % of the .99 cents & you keep the other %\n",

      "3155. That dropping phone transition... that's what I'm talking about right there\n",

Good luck with the app, I bet it will be top ten and bring in a bucket of cash regardless!\n",

A plain orange wallpaper that you could get with a simple google search and some fiddling with the filters if you wanna be particular about it.

      "3193. So this is what they teach you at business school. Charge $50 for a wallpaper app üòÇ Even the frisbees you throw are cheaper than the app.\n",
      "3194. The fact that Apple Intelligence wasn't shipped with the phone is a major L for Apple. Sure it may be 3-4 months before we get it, and we will get it, but you're right the marketing around these new devices was/is all about Apple Intelligence. Tim Cook is really showing he's not Steve Jobs because he would've NEVER let this hit the market without these features included, even if it meant delaying the phone's launch. I think this phone could have been delayed a few months while waiting on these new features, or delay it until iPhone 17, but Apple knew there wasn't going to be much incentive to upgrade. The iPhone 16 is essentially the iPhone 15S.\n",
      "3195. I bought the 16 Pro Max 1TB... only because I accidentally destroyed my 14 Pro Max microphone with compressed air. Yep, I learned my lesson. The battery health was also at 85%, and noticeable. Then it suddenly started getting hot with radio errors when I didn't have signal. Luckily, I got $800 for a trade-in. Otherwise, I don't really get the hype of this new phone running iOS 18.0. I wouldn't have upgraded unless I had to. So now, I guess I'm hoping for what can be, unburdened by what has been. ü§£\n",

      "3197. I know this will probably get lost in the comments.. but I didn't see this anywhere in the first 50 or so, so I'm gonna say it. Paying for high quality wallpapers (it's art that someone created) is not unheard of. It's kind of like paying any artist for anything... photographers, painters, etc... it's digital art, and it's a method of helping artists sell their designs... it's not really that difficult to understand that, and I think that's going over a lot of people's heads.\n",

For $4 a month you get cool wallpapers and support artist. I'm saying this from someone who hates art. I truly believe that art is one of the most useless degrees out there, but after taking a college art class, I do give my respect to artists.

Even so, my guess is that Apple Intelligence will need a year or so to sort out and become a game changer feature. I'm still rocking the 14 Pro Max and I'm thinking I could skip this year _again_. Honestly, the most compelling feature is just the ability to go all-in on USB-C finally - but that happened last year. I suppose for $1400, I can put up with lightning another year.

      "3247. Clearly unpopular but $4.16/month which is what $50/year breaks down to is not bad considering the app directly supports the artists with a 50/50 revenue split is pretty fair. Everyone complains about people not paying artists for their work and AI is ruining artistry. But MKBHD puts out an app that sure isn‚Äôt free, but does directly support artists and they complain. \n",

If the only reason is because it gives profits to the artist, sorry, but the common consumer doesn't care. This app will need to be much more convenient and give more features than if I were to just download an image off DDG for me to consider buying a 1-time fee for it, let alone an insanely pricy subscription or waste my time watching an ad each time I want to change it\n",

From all the apps I‚Äôve tried so far they have the biggest wallpaper library and best part is it‚Äôs free. It‚Äôs 2024, I don‚Äôt think anyone should pay and ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù to a wallpaper app and it has never been since the beginning of time. In my point of view there are certain apps that deserves a subscription such as ad free experience on YouTube, Spotify.. maybe Notion.

A complete overhaul like with Gemini and Apple Intelligence takes a lot of time to get right. I don‚Äôt think any of us would want some buggy ai, I would much prefer to wait for these features to be perfect than have a half ass feature that hardly(if at all) works. And the backlash Apple would receive from that would be tremendous, Google and Samsung have a little bit a leeway and slack since they‚Äôre not as ‚Äúpremium‚Äù per say.

People here are hating on the app for having a subscription, but as a software developer myself, I can tell you that having a subscription in my apps is the only way for me to make any profit these days. Making apps used to be easier 10 years ago because technology was limited, and people‚Äôs expectations were very low. So many developers made thousands of dollars making fart noises apps. Nowadays, people expect apps to provide real value, have nice visuals, and be extremely polished. Let alone being constantly updated to meet the latest trends. And trust me, that‚Äôs a lot of work. Developers nowadays barely make money on apps they develop for years. All that being said, $50 is too expensive, and a subscription-based pricing model might not work well for this exact app. A small price (like $0.99) per wallpaper might be more appropriate since the real value is the wallpaper itself and not the actual functionality of the app.\n",

      "3599. Hey, I love your videos and how personable you make them. But I miss the video now that you could be stricter. The way you say it so correctly is too reserved for me, I don't mean that you say some crap without thinking. But the 60hz thing, for example, is unacceptable and the fact that Apple constantly talks everything up in an unrealistic way is extremely annoying. I now have the Pixel 9 Pro Fold for the first time because they are simply not innovative enough for me. Compared to the price, of course. I want an iPhone Fold so much but that will probably take some time. A flip, for example, doesn't interest me at all. I'm only saying this from my personal point of view, of course, but I find them really outrageous now. I'm standing in front of the new iPhones today and I've NEVER had the feeling that they bore me. But today I do, but our customers don't really like them either. It's not enough for them. Apple has somehow been asleep for quite some time and YOU are the only one who could wake them up with your reach. Don't be mean, but just say straight out how ridiculous what's happening is.

This drives me crazy. As an iPhone user, I do not care about the new features over the past few years. As a shareholder, I'm just hoping AI goes better than expected. At this point, I have a bad feeling about it. Siri has been terrible for over 10 years. I just can't see this being any better in practice to 90% of users.

I also find it noteworthy that a company by the likes of Apple and their long-game feature, production and distribution chain + being very conservative about the introduction of new features that would be on par with other products on the market, seems to be in disarray more and more each year. It used to be common that devices were introduced to the US market first and (sometimes) even much much later in other parts of the world and they have worked it out pretty well over the past - I want to say - 10 years, yet recently, with Apple Vision for example, the pendulum seems to swing back in the other direction. For someone with Your access: I‚Äôd love to hear something about the A-I trajectory for Europe.

I know a fair amount of people who still only have 1080p monitors (if that depending on if they just have a cheap laptop or something). So feels like there's almost no point to put 8k on something like a smartphone? Though of course there's the argument of at least give people the option if they want it, and if not they could simply not record in 8k. But I just sort of imagine it's just not a priority\n",

On top of that, shoving this in at the begining of your likely most popular video of the year, seems pretty cynical. This could've easily been it's own dedicated announcement video, seperate to any other works, but instead here it is, in a video likely to hit 20 million views in a couple days.

It is 2024 and anything that needs subscription is not made with consumer‚Äôs interest in mind imo to a certain degree. I‚Äôm sure the artists will be partners and all that but there had to be a better way or time to explain the app and it‚Äôs features. And I‚Äôm waiting for the explanation for that $50 price because I can‚Äôt think of anything that I can gain by giving an app $50 (not that I have that much or I‚Äôll pay if I have the money) especially when it‚Äôs being marketed as a wallpaper app when I‚Äôm just using default one for all my devices because it‚Äôs funny to me (my MacBook of 7 years broke down and can‚Äôt afford another so that‚Äôs one down out of 3 devices). And people have a been complaining about YouTube subscription for months now which at least allows you to watch something worthwhile and I don‚Äôt know if the wallpapers or things that will be added later will be worthy that price‚Ä¶. Those were my initial thoughts right after watching it and hope to see it turns out good so good luck I guess.

It's a great upgrade and a great phone. let's be honest- the iPhone 5 was all the smart phone any of us ever needed. if battery degradation wasn't a thing then I'd still happily be on the 5 and it would be perfectly great.

Yea there‚Äôs ads but at least I can be certain (blind trust) that creators are actually getting compensated. That 50/50 split I think is really nice. $50a year to supports creators doesn‚Äôt sound all that bad to me. But thats just my take. Nonetheless y‚Äôall complaining but the app is #2 as of typing.

      "Not to mention wanting user data for a wallpaper app? Are you selling user data as well?\n",
      "5056. I am still rockin a iPhone 11. Battery is good, still seems snappy. I basically only upgrade when Apple stops supporting the device and I can no longer get updates.\n",

Do you really thing that a ‚Äûnew‚Äú ‚Äûbutton‚Äú is going to make me buy a new iPhone. I guess not! And even the other ‚Äûnew‚Äú stuff‚Ä¶ it was eighter a software update or a change to USB-C.

But If we show these tech giants now that we do not like it by not buying the most popular phone then maybe tech companies will stop doing it.\n",
      "5078. Zzzz this felt like a rant. Saying the same thing over and over is boooooooring. Why not testing 3D video recording and viewing it on the Apple goggles? Is  that not ready either?\n",

      "5151. What would be cool is if they used the capacitive camera button to allow scrolling just using your thumb on the side of the phone. No one is going to be using it for anything else let‚Äôs be honest!!\n",
      "5152. First we need a whole section on panels from Canadian artist featuring Canadian themes on the panels. I'm in Canada and won't be getting AI anytime this year I don't think. If that is the case, then I can easily skip to the 17 Pro. What I want from the action button is a way to take a fast, zoomed in to fill the frame picture n under one second from when I raise the phone point at my target (Usually an approaching sports car like a Porche 918 Spyder)  and touch the button  I usually have  maybe 10 -20 seconds to see, get my camera phone, trigger the camera, zoom and shoot. I want AI to do that using the camera control. having a button that does what I can do on the touch screen is almost useless to me. If I have time to set up the photograph, I don't need a button dedicated to it. The other issue that no one is talking about is what about left-handed people. we have to turn it upside down (And not be able to see the button (It's going to be worse with a case on it) and then do everything in reverse. I have an issue involving a disability as well. I am missing a thumb on my right hand so I will not be able to hold the phone and use the camera control since I need three fingers to physically hold the camera steady and keep it from pivoting. I can't hold it steady with two fingers and use my index finger to manipulate the camera control, So the camera control has no value to me. Until they realize they can tie AI into that button and make it really useful for framing, focussing and taking the picture. The final issue is my g/f has a Samsung. For the most recent lunar eclipse she just pointed her phone at the moon and zoomed all the way in and came up with a clear sort of the eclipse nd a fairly good amount of detail of the craters. Try that on your iPhone. you end up with something that looks like you focussed in on a streetlight. Completely blowout and lens flare like crazy. (I thought I was on the bridge of the enterprise during a battle) I must set up tripod, turn down the brightness slider down to 25%. then take several images as several brightness levels. I then go to photoshop and superposition them together to get an image that is 25% better than the Samsung. AI needs to step in and do all that for me when the phone is pointing towards the moon, and I touch the camera control. It needs to take control lof the shot and make the shot better than I can by manually setting the controls. Apple totally missed this idea of what a camera control is for. It can take control and take a better shot than you can!!\n",

Really looking forward to it if you can get an Apple employee and let them ‚Äúknow‚Äù how big of an issue it is at night, I have been noticing this since iphone 12 and still they haven‚Äôt improved it at all.

But if I didn't need Logic Pro X, I would still be using that laptop. And I consider this use case to be somewhat of a fringe/niche case, since most people aren't music producers. Plus, part of me thinks that Logic Pro X would work just fine for light music production on my old MacBook but that Apple is arbitrarily cutting support for that OS, probably so that they don't need to keep updating it. Like I understand why they need to do that, it's just still annoying though. Why can't I just download an older version lol?\n",

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs that bad. The issue is that there are so many wallpapers available freely online. And now with AI you can make your own. This app and pricing makes more sense for content creators who need dozens if not hundreds of wallpapers per year. However it is not being marketed as such. I think the worst part is how terrible the free version is. You might as well make it subscription only.\n",

      "\n",
      "If it‚Äôs something users (or developers) can access, it‚Äôs fair game, though with increasing levels of salt as you get more ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù. I‚Äôve been using the Dev Beta since before launch, so I have been commenting on what features are available ‚Äútoday‚Äù. And apparently, the Public Beta has been available since Day Two of the iPhone launch. So, some base aspects of Apple Intelligence are here ‚Äútoday‚Äù, just with Apple‚Äôs newer take on ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù in mind. These are clearly not just future promises anymore. By contrast, a lot of the GenAI image stuff isn‚Äôt in any beta ‚Äútoday‚Äù, nor is the comprehensive and highly contextual new Siri. Those *are* promises, and could be scrapped at any time. But‚Ä¶Apple does have that track record. Here‚Äôs the thing: you don‚Äôt have to buy the phone ‚Äútoday‚Äù. If the current slew of beta limited Apple Intelligence features doesn‚Äôt justify the upgrade yet, then simply wait until new features are (very likely) added in the future, then maybe reconsider. Pretty simple calculus. \n",
      "\n",
      "In short, if Apple is making something available in a Dev Beta, they are basically saying, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre confident in [this feature] and are ready for you [developers] to start playing with it and building apps based on it.‚Äù Not a promise, but a ‚Äúshipped‚Äù feature. It could change, but then again, so could any feature (remember 3D Touch?). And over time, new features will eventually be released, and if a new iPhone doesn‚Äôt make sense ‚Äútoday‚Äù, then perhaps it might make sense ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù.\n",
      "5500. That \"slightly different almost the same\" statement every year becomes tiring to say the least when you have a bigger screen (however this is achieved) bigger battery one additional BUTTON on the chassis ... i mean what was the new feature that Samsung introduced this year on the top model? ... and I always find it weird when people with deep extended knowledge on the topic expect mind boggling earth moving changes EVERY YEAR on a device that is more powerfull than most laptops only a few years ago!!!! i mean cmooon!\n",

No to come out in too strong a defence of apple here, but we the consumer and the tech review industry demand regular yearly updates to software and hardware and when it‚Äôs not quite ready we‚Äôre incredulous. There was a time not too long ago when companies released software when it was ready, not on a schedule. I think it was fair to give Fisker, AI pin and the rabbit a failing grade, the products were barely usable. NOT the case here, it‚Äôs still a fully functioning phone that is missing one feature. Apple has a pretty good track record of announcing something and then releasing what was announced. Maybe they should have delayed release of the phone‚Ä¶but could you imagine what tech YouTube would have to say about that??\n",

      "5667. It would‚Äôve been better for everyone if you just partnered up with an artist once a month and you took a percentage of revenue. Panels sucks. Even saw a ‚Äúwallpaper‚Äù that was literally just the colour orange, and you‚Äôre offering it at a cost?\n",
      "5668. Might sound harsh, but I really wanted to get this off my chest:\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets boring to hear the same ‚Äûwhat‚Äòs actually new‚Äú and ‚Äûthere‚Äòs hardly any changes‚Äú when there are a ton of changes. Yet, the whole picture and comparison are flawed by comparing products in a way that doesn‚Äòt make sense. Can you compare the regular model to the premium one? Surely. Should you? I don‚Äòt think so. If you compare the premium line of last year (has a powerful processor, good cameras etc.) to the regular model, then obviously the regular model doesn‚Äòt seem like that much of a change. Not just that; it makes more sense to compare the regular models as people who have them will most likely go for the regular model next time as their decision for the past purchase will likely have had its reason. If, however, people go for the premium model from a regular model, they will likely compare that model with the one they already have, not the one before as they want to see what changes there are in comparison to what they already have. All the 30% and something something improvements/changes add up to quite a lot down the road. There surely are lots of people upgrading yearly. However most, I dare to guess, will upgrade not as often, which is why these year-to-year comparisons, other than by the company itself, don‚Äòt make sense. This has been feeling like it‚Äòs just a hunt for ‚Äûgo get the newest one instead of holding the company to its promises of longevity‚Äú. Man, I can still see some people walking around with an iPhone 8 and 7. But comparing these would be too much work and not as attractive for ‚Äûwhat actually changed‚Äú, right? I really love the choice of music, the intro animation and shots. But there‚Äòs almost no real world usage shown, only telling. Definitely prefer iJustine for that, despite her overly positive reviews. This channel feels a lot more superficial than it has in the past, tbh.\n",
      "5669. 2:51 Went straight to the comments to see Marques get cooked. Not surprised. Well done guys!\n",

      "5685. You have to watch 2 ads to download a SD wallpaper?? Seriously? Even if it was a HD photo, that‚Äôs insane. PASS\n",
      "5686. The intro is nice, don't get me wrong, but I think the scratch design are getting a little bit dated for MKBHD standards.\n",
      "5687. can we talk about that intro?! holy crap, amazing\n",
      "5688. This is gonna inspire an episode of Black Mirror.\n",

      "5694. Guys, phones aren't suposed to be ultra revolutionary from year to year, that's impossible. The point is that, when your phone is 4-6 years old, you get the latest one and feel all the improvements from your old phone. This is the same with every phone brand out there.\n",
      "5695. The worst thing about Panels is that probably this was created as an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù effort to make a platform to expose artists and their artworks to new kinds of public. If that so, why no better do an app which allows to see the artworks filtered by artists or by hot or new wallpapers or whatever, and allow people to buy the wallpapers without any need of suscription?\n",
      "5696. Does the camera button work with the whole app they developed to give us control over our camera‚Ä¶\n",
      "5697. $50 for a wallpaper app, which you could get for free? Wow .\n",

      "5706. I don't really have any excuse to upgrade my 12 pro max, it truly works well. Which is a minor miracle seeing as I am going caseless this past year or so and have dropped it multiple times, its a tough phone, I will say that much. Apple got me with the apple watch ultra in the black though, I've upgraded from a series 7. I'm on day one and I'm very happy with my decision to upgrade.\n",

      "5718. after seeing the app, I find iPhone 16 is OK now\n",
      "5719. In a time when everyone can generate ai garbage whenever they want, it is very refreshing to see putting real effort into something like wallpapers, and I‚Äôm glad they are making sure the artists are compensated for their work. So many people think once artwork is on the internet it‚Äôs free, but it‚Äôs not.\n",
      "5720. No thank you to Panels.  I'll just use Pinterest which is free and shows me more of what I'm actually looking for without paying more.\n",
      "5721. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda fun to be on the development side‚Äù yeah you mad a wallpaper app for $50/m\n",
      "5722. Even wallpaper engine for pc is cheaper and that too is a onetime purchase.\n",
      "5723. I really don't get your point about the new camera button\n",
      "It's not like it changes the actual camera setting of your phone, all it does is to change the post processing... so basically what editing does anyway. It's way too finicky for it to be useful, and im quite sure that normal editing is better and faster\n",

      "5729. wait, you can customize while taking photos? like what is Sony is doing for the last 4-5 years? Sony is selling lenses to apple, wait a few more years and iphones will have a \"special new app\" that would look like an \"Alpha like\" experience...\n",

      "5743. Apple asking us to trust them and buy this phone for future Intelligence update, when they literaly betrayed by saying battey is gonna be 30% longer when it actually js just 9%. Wow. Its just how easy for apple to manipulate their true regular customers.\n",

      "5749. I think Apple has earned their reputation with timely software updates, so I don‚Äôt see a big issues waiting a few months for them to get AI right. Whereas a company like Tesla had people paying for FSD and still waiting years for it to be available.\n",
      "5750. Nice video Marques. I know it doesn't matter much to you but there's a trend of buying the Pro Max for gaming and streaming. How good is the chip in regards to gaming, considering the fact that the performance difference between the 8 Gen 3 and the A17Pro in terms of graphic fidelity was a massive 80+%, and gaming is optimised on iOS as compared to most Androids, including flagships? Also, most people do trust the promise of software when it comes to certain brands. Writing this on an S21 fe with the august patch introducing circle to search and other AI features.\n",

Sony are currently using 3.5x to 7.1x and the fact that it's optical all the way to 7.1x from 3.5x is great. That's roughly how far people will zoom anyway. It Samsung or Pixel do it first, by going the extra mile and doing 1x to 10x, that would be a game changer. Going a step further would be 0.5x to 12x and only having one single camera at the back of your phone. With the lens being 2-3x as big as the current one. This is the game changing feature that I am waiting for. But I bet we still won't get it, even when we're in the 2030s with the iPhone 23 and newer \n",

But both or at least the watch charging speed is slow. 5w, when the watch charging speed takes more than 20w. My guess is that it takes 25-30w charging speed now. Someone will have to confirm with me, what the max it takes. But the new anker products are outdated sadly already. Especially the 3 in 1 puck. As the magsafe is 15w and it now supports 25w. So, those products need an update already. But I see 25w magsafe staying for at least 4-5 years, so they have about a year, to make a 25w magsafe and 25w+ watch charging speed product. What would have been perfect, is if the small 3 in 1 puck was a mini power bank that was upto 5000mah\n",

As of last year I have switched to an iPhone 15 Pro after being a life long android user.  As you and many people know there are features where Apple is behind when compared to android.  One feature in particular that bothers me that iPhones don‚Äôt have is a toggle switch in the control center to turn on/off location services.  If you can somehow get the word out to Apple that this little tweak will be much appreciated, thanks.\n",

      "6067. I disagree with your conclusion. Even if you are using an near obsolete model, never buy a new one with unfinished features because this will become the trend in the future. Look at phones that ship without chargers, games full of bugs and so on.\n",

      "6070. 17:15 there is another difference: the iPhone 16 is an improvement to the 15 at the same price. So even if they would never ship Apple Intelligence, the product would not compare to the other named unfinished devices‚Ä¶\n",

This comment section is a beautiful display of people who either cannot read, listen, or both. \"No one's paying $50 a year for a regular wallpaper app lil bro\" My brother in Christ, the app is free. The subscription is purely to show support AND because there's more to come to the app, so it won't just be \"a regular wallpaper app\". It genuinely baffles me how people straight up ignore the free option, because it's worse (I mean, are you really surprised? Like actually, are you?) and then go and dog on the paid version. I understand where y'all are coming from, but at the same time it's very ignorant and childish. Worst case scenario you can just use the free version, take a screenshot, use reverse image search to find an HD version of the wallpaper, and use that. It's a little more work, but if you have enough time to complain about it, then you also have enough time to do something about it. We live in a time, where if someone has a problem, rather than doing something about it and trying to find solutions, they'd rather complain, and when someone offers up a solution, they'll complain even more for some reason. And I can already see your comments about how marques isn't gonna give me a tesla (which I wouldn't want even for free), or how I should stop with the glaze, or how I should zip it up after I'm done. I've seen all of those comments before. You guys are not original whatsoever. You guys are just a bunch of simplistic young naive fools, who copy tiktok phrases, comments, and insults, and think you're extremely funny. Not an ounce of your own thought in your mind. I hope you guys grow up quickly and start thinking for yourselves. Peace.\n",

That way, the placement could move when shooting in portrait or landscape to be in the best place rather than just an ok place in either orientation. Moreover, that would have allowed it to roll out in an iOS update and make it usable to more people since it would be a software update rather than a hardware update.

We as consumers have become so accustomed to getting everything for free, but that doesn't have to be the norm. My only feedback for the app would be to allow users to buy individual (high quality) wallpapers or in packs of three instead of a monthly subscription. Other than that, shoutout to Adam Molina, Vinh Dang, Brandon Havard, and David Imel - great to see your work there as well! Hope you get the love and appreciation you deserve.\n",

You'd have to hold the phone less then 5 inches from your face before you start seeing even some of the resolution increase and more like 2-3 inches for all of it.

I can also pay more than a decent meal costs just for a single wallpaper collection with 5 pictures. Some nicer ones are only available through the subscription. If wallpapers can be monetized at all (doubt) this pricing tier is just nuts - costs way more than music? The 50/50 revenue split is also kind of wild considering you're basically hosting some images, the cheapest media to host by far.

It‚Äôs an insider joke that you‚Äôre using these devices longer than anyone else, but what exactly are you doing with that extra time? You rush through all the obvious changes and don‚Äôt give any deep insights about anything. You literally just reused footage from the launch event (the motocross video in slo-mo). It really feels like you just walk around the studio for B-roll and let your editors add some fancy animations. I‚Äôve watched so many other reviews, and they‚Äôre all trying their best to add value by actually comparing the battery (which seems to be objectively better, so your subjective opinion is extremely misleading), or the camera, or by finding something else that distinguishes them from the rest. SnazzyLabs is a good example of someone who waits longer to publish a video in order to really add a unique view of a product. You used to do that too, but now you‚Äôre the most basic reviewer. Sorry, I really am, because it shows that you‚Äôve basically gone from being ‚Äúcreative indie‚Äù to ‚Äúmainstream corporate,‚Äù where it‚Äôs more about hitting deadlines and getting views rather than offering genuine insights or a fresh perspective. The whole buzz about Panels just underlines all of that.\n",

Android flagships have gone through generations of fast charging (What are we at now? Quick Charge 5 and/or USB-PD 3.1?), and had 45W charging 4 years before Apple finally got there. (Example: SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 Ultra, released in March 2020, advertised 45W charging with PD3.0.) Plus there's the aspect that fast charging isn't necessarily good for your battery. (Most Android phones I know actually let you turn it off in the battery maintenance settings. I've set up Tasker on mine to only turn on Super Fast charging when I'm not at home, that way my regular charging is nice to the battery, but I can get a quick boost form a power bank when on the go.)\n",

      "7236. For me, avoiding the hate for the app, the segment about AI is rather disappointing as AI is now ongoing and will be for years. It is coming, and to suggest it won't seem like pushing a bad narrative. I have been using it for 6 weeks on beta, so why would you doubt that it will not come?\n",
      "\n",
      "As for marketing, Apple would be making a big mistake if it didn't aggressively promote Apple Intelligence, even if it's launching from October to December. Suggesting otherwise shows a lack of business sense, and the criticism he's receiving for his wallpaper app doesn't help his case. Examples are Snapdragon laptops pushing Recall despite that still being AWOL and Google pushing Android 15 when that didn't come with the Pixel 9. Or is it one rule for Apple? \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe treat the phone and software as different products, and Apple and Google have been releasing them in stages for years because the same creators that push for early release will troll and flex hard if they release an unfinished buggy product.

There is value to providing a guaranteed AI-free collection of images where the artists are correctly paid.

Many people don't change wallpapers too often and paying 50$ for effectively 2 wallpapers is too steep.\n",

Again: that's pretty shit, I feel artists should get at least 80%. They make the wallpapers, you just distribute them. And sure you can argue that they need a platform to be able to earn off of their wallpapers in the first place and you give them that platform, but without those artists you wouldn't have anything to show for anyway.

Yes the pixel rates infer it should have enough video encoding performance, but and this is the big BUT, hardware video encoders often work on register based linestores (and a lot of them) to store current and surrounding pixel and compression standard based metadata, that is necessary for encoding to work. A 4K line store cannot be used for 8k video. A set of 8k linestores is a massive amount of silicon and will need a complete redesign of the hardware encoders and decoders to utilise them . Yes Apple have the capability to do so, but that is extra R&D cost for what real gain? Alternatively they can speed up or multi-core existing 4K hardware video codec cores to get 4kp120 much much easier and for significantly lower R&D cost.\n",

      "7728. How did MrWhosetheboss pass Marques‚Äô subscribers?\n",
      "7729. I feel like Apple listened, but in their own way. For years androids had much more control over the camera, and everyone wanted iOS to have it too. But instead of software controls, Apple made it a button, which I am not a fan of tbh.\n",
      "7730. I saw the tweet about the app, I have no idea why I came to the comment section of the video first before watching the video, its not looking good bruv\n",

      "7741. POOR US. WE ARE THE VICTIMS. I can‚Äôt believe we were exposed to this horrible wallpaper idea. I got PTSD from the app and won‚Äôt recover. I got a heart attack in my brain. Poor us.\n",
      "7742. There is an irony to the talk of Apple AI not being finisher but Apple advertising it and then the panels app being put on a sub (for full functionality) for the reason that there is more to come.\n",
      "7743. Can't find Panels in France ... just like apple, promises ^^\n",
      "7744. App crashes on Honor Magic V3 and my guess is the wallpapers isn't sized for the folding screen....'the most unfinished wallpaper app launch ever'\n",
      "7745. is it just me or you guys also feel like Apple has started to acknowledge other companies, Like earlier Apple used to live in a bubble where they were the only smartphone company but it‚Äôs not the same case anymore\n",
      "7746. Bro, never cook again.üßë‚Äçüç≥\n",
      "7747. Marques really has to dig deeper for his reviews. I know he does reviews for the broad mass of people but there are things worth it upgrading even coming from an iPhone 15 Pro Max (which most people obviously shouldn‚Äôt do). It‚Äòs all about what you need and prefer in a smartphone.\n",
      "For example the new 16PM doesn‚Äôt throttle as much as the 15PM while playing games or being outdoors in the sun as tests are showing. For me that‚Äôs huge since my 15PM did dim the display after like 1 minute outdoors in the summer (in rainy Germany).\n",
      "Furthermore the battery life is noticeable better and the A18 Pro gets better performance while needing less Watts and energy as the A17 Pro in general as Geekerwan showed. It‚Äòs really efficient, especially the little cores.\n",
      "The smaller bezels are great for people who love design like me. It keeps the phone modern for longer.\n",
      "The new main camera sensor has zero shutter lag even in the 48MP mode which is absolutely huge if you compare how long it took to shoot on an 14PM.\n",
      "Ultrawide sensor obviously better.\n",
      "The glass is tougher and also gets you better longevity. The new Titanium finish feels nice. \n",
      "There are lots and lots of huge little upgrades which make this phone worth an upgrade. Apple Intelligence is just a nice feature on top for me. I don‚Äòt need it immediately. I got enough AI Apps.\n",
      "For me the upgrade is more noticeable going from 15PM‚Äî>16PM as it was going from 14PM‚Äî>15PM.\n",
      "We are at a point where you simply can‚Äòt put much more tech into these great devices. There will be new innovations comming.\n",
      "7748. Marques can never speak on the Magic Mouse again after this\n",
      "7749. 12:43 the bloom is annoying\n",
      "7750. ¬£11.5 a month!üòÖ you gotta be kidding me\n",

      "7753. Bro is finding it hard to maintain the Porsche.\n",
      "7754. $50 per year for AI generated wallpaper?\n",
      "7755. If the Kamera Controll don‚Äôt match your left index turn your phone 180 and use your right thumb. Fits perfect.\n",
      "7756. I recently realised how apple has been working towards making products/features that media personnel would love, getting positive reviews inturn. \n",
      "Apple silicon launch was the biggest example - final cut availability & optimization on day 1 was no coincidence. Every reviewer wanted to try it, because everyone of them needs to edit videos. Ended up giving apple silicon the positive platform to build upon. \n",
      "Yes there were gremlins, but those didn't matter when the entire media was ecstatic to see the capabilities in apps they use extensively. \n",
      "It meant to showcase the peak when 95% apps were emulated. Rosetta was decent, but it is in the same ball park as WindowsARM with worse native app support 4 years ago for apple. Yet apple succeeded where MS & Qualcomm didn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "The camera control BUTTON is just another such use case, it makes the reviewers happy, who can probably extract some magical shots with their knowledge, but will never mean more than a hardware trigger for 99% of buyers, who just saw the glowing review of new iPhone cameras. A h/w trigger(volume button) that already exists in every phn I have ever used\n",

      "7788. Wallpapers are nice on your app but most of us have phones with over 1080p resolution. So I believe that free wallpapers (with ads) should have a bit higher resolution. I see at this moment the app design that do not have enough of the hook for the users to even want to try premium version\n",
      "7789. The iPhone 16 series is a half baked, beta-stage product and the control button is unnecessary and cumbersome. It's a failed product with no innovation.\n",

      "7799. I was about to download the app. Than i read the comments and changed my mind.\n",

      "7807. I literally can‚Äôt tell a difference between 60FPS and 120FPS on my phone it‚Äôs crazy. Like when playing video games on my consoles it‚Äôs highly noticeable for me but just watching videos on Youtube on my phone it makes no difference. Prime example I got the Galaxy S24 Ultra this year which obviously has a 120hz display but I also just recently bought an iPad Mini and have been using it to watch YouTube and do all the stuff I do on my phone on it(accept game) and the experience for me has been pretty much the same. I really don‚Äôt notice the fact the iPad Mini only has a 60hz display it just doesn‚Äôt seem to make that big a difference watching YouTube videos. Now when it comes to video games like Doom Eternal or Halo Infinite on my Xbox Series X on my 65‚Äù 120hz 4KTV it‚Äôs highly noticeable and 120FPS is game changing.\n",
      "7808. I remembered Apple fans making fun of companies launching products with software promises for \"later this year\" and for a long time Apple was the only company with an impecable software launch across all devices, but yeah... It's even worst on MacOS tbh\n",
      "7809. Most shots fired yet in an MKBHD iPhone review. No lies told though\n",

      "7818. Why not wait til the AI features come out and then buy it? Why?\n",
      "7819. I prefer Apple over all because they have the most complete of features that are done. I upgraded this year because I had to for work and my xr was dying constantly. This is the first year in Apple history where they used software to sell a new model and it isn‚Äôt on the launch day phones.\n",

      "7825. I'll be honest! I tried the app and it was horrible. It is too expensive for what it does and the wallpaper selections are mid af, poor labeling, can't see the wallpaper full screen and almost everything requires you to watch ads. The app needs a major overhaul\n",
      "7826. Bro graduated from the Logan Paul school of cash grabbing. After all these years Marques finally did us dirty\n",

      "7830. Magical and game changing\n",
      "7831. The funny thing about camera control is the fact every year there is that cut-out slice for the cellular bands to get out; it was nice that they turned it into additional functionality. You have to wonder if that was the inspiration for having another button.\n",

      "7835. I don't understand why so much criticism around not releasing AI with the phones. After all these years Apple can be trusted enough for delivering perfection. Whenever they make a promise they make sure that they deliver the promise. Give them some credit. No need for such heavy criticism.\n",
      "7836. One suggestion: turn down the volume of those new transition clips (chapter covers). The sudden rise in volume is really annoying and actually disturbs your signature vibe that your videos usually have.\n",
      "7837. Bro. I respect you. But $50? Are you pulling an apple? And you‚Äôre saying buy it for what it is not the promise of what it can be. Its a WALLPAPER app.\n",
      "7838. The arrogance of I can put this wallpaper app out and people will buy into it. Out of touch. Quick to call out others on their faults. Fail here. Milking the fanbase not a good look.\n",

      "7841. Let's remember what incremental actually means, they use that term to not offend the smartphones manufacturer and not get on their bad side. In reality incremental means, nothing has changed and nothing is really changing. Incremental is very minor and meaningless changes, they made the bezels thinner, wow that's incredible.

You don‚Äôt have to keep the subscription on, and it works out to $4 a month.

Why is he  just reading off Apple's website for the battery and expressing vague skepticism instead of showing us real results? What is it like to have the 1 nit brightness and does that make a difference at night? How about actually telling us how much faster 45 watt charging is in real world time and if the extra heat degrades the battery any faster? Other channels measured the power draw and it's not actually 45 watts, where is the mention of that? What about the internal changes that make the iPhone more repairable? Not a single example of a 120fps video or comparing video/camera quality side-by-side with previous iPhones and flagship android phones? iPhone photos still look \"iPhone-y\"?

I kept my iPhone 11 Pro, not trading it in when I bought the 16 Pro because it‚Äôs useful as a dev device). I bought the iPhone 16 Pro on Day One in anticipation of the Apple Intelligence features. Though they aren‚Äôt available yet, I feel like I‚Äôm in possession of the Infinity Gauntlet without its Infinity Stones in place. While the iPhone 16 Pro doesn‚Äôt have the one crucial feature that will make it truly special‚ÄîApple Intelligence‚Äîwhen that feature is released in a month or two, we have no idea what the state of iPhone 16 stock will be. Supply chain issues or high demand could cause it to sell out by then! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not taking any chances and keeping my iPhone 16 Pro safe in a sturdy Vibranium case, ready to wield when I get my special AI powers.\n",

I also don‚Äôt like the idea of the new iPhones being AI devices, that seems like something they should‚Äôve only put in the pro phones, or made a separate lineup for. That way people like me that don‚Äôt want anything to do with it, arent being forced to have it natively on their phones. All in all, this years newest iphone lineup is a 2/10 upgrade. Battery, and camera button is really all they have going for them, and its minus one point for making the claims of a better battery, but every single review says that they don‚Äôt notice any difference in battery life, even though the actual phones are bigger. So, that brings us to a 1/10 review.\n",

That is a LOT of data for a wallpaper app... You're someone who guides people through the tech landscape, and knowing how bad data breaches have gotten, you must understand that frivolous data collection like this is contributing to the problem. We tech nerds gotta set an example of being much more transparent about why certain data is needed (for advertising, for example, I get it, you gotta get paid), and resist collecting anything that isn't needed.

Yes it‚Äôs noticeable, but after using it for like half an hour, I was capable of going back to my iPhone without missing it. Yes, it was a neat little thing, but after 2 hours, I didn‚Äôt even think about it anymore. OLED used to be much more of a quality of life improvement than any of the AI based features missing as of now. Heck, 2000 nits in sunlight are!

      "9387. Panels is an incredibly well-designed app, so big shout out to the team who put all that effort into developing the app. It‚Äôs smooth, with crisp animations and a simple interface that‚Äôs easy to use. Not to mention it‚Äôs beautiful - hands down the best wallpaper app I‚Äôve ever used. But at a discounted price of $49.99/year, that‚Äôs just too steep, especially when you consider that the full price is around $143/year. I know there might be new features coming, but as it stands I wouldn‚Äôt be willing to pay more than $25/year for a wallpaper app, no matter how well it‚Äôs designed. Also, the fact that no wallpaper comes in higher resolutions unless you subscribe feels like a cash grab. Especially since you know your YouTube audience are the kind of people who want the best resolution because it‚Äôs what we like. Maybe I‚Äôm alone in feeling this way, but I still find it a bit icky. Overall it‚Äôs a great app, but just too expensive. Until the price drops or crazy new features get added, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll use it for more than a few weeks.\n",

Wow, you can move the icons around, and stylize them. I feel like in some ways there's no need for real innovation.

I can't say i've met a single person who has paid for wallpapers outside of using it as a means to support someone/something, i.e. Apollo for reddit and their wallpaper pack as they were shut down.

MY only thing is that if a new SE is coming out that is barebones with usb-c I would rather get that and run that for 3-4 years than buy a new flagship. I‚Äôve done the flagship and after the novelty wears out I rarely use my phone for anything other than calls, checking my calendar and responding to messages and email and you don‚Äôt need a lot of power for that. Add on top that phone calls and messages can show up on iPad or Mac and even windows means most days my phone does not leave my pocket. I might use it for a selfie or picture when hanging out with family or friends but usually there is the one person in the group that loves doing that and I‚Äôm happy to let them.\n",

It‚Äôs equivalent to me wanting the nano cell TV on a 65 inch TV over getting a 95 inch TV with no nano cell technology or any TV with gaming in mind. Like, I get it. I almost want to buy my kid an iPhone pro so they can appreciate 120 Hz instead of the whatever Hz that‚Äôs on an SE I don‚Äôt even know. I just know I don‚Äôt like looking at their iPhone too long and I appreciate my 14 Pro Max. And hopefully apple intelligence comes out before I get my 16 Pro Max because they said the end of October for me. And I periodically keep checking the shipping date and it has yet to change. But back to Hz. I get it. Some people just like big TVs whether they are clear or not. Just the whole mindset of go big or go home. That‚Äôs all that matters to them. And I‚Äôm focused on nano cell technology. I‚Äôm in Best Buy asking and testing out screen quality. And they‚Äôre teasing me saying they got a 90 inch at Costco cheaper than what I paid for a 65 inch. And neither of us are wrong. I like 120 Hz.

I wanted a great camera, awesome screen, and the best battery available from an iOS device and I landed here. Performance is great, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs meaningfully faster than my 14 PM or Pixel 7 Pro. However the battery life is just incredible. Ending a 10 hour shift with 60% battery is amazing!

If you do it like $10 or $12/year would get more people to subscribe. 500K people subscribing $10/year is ways better than 100K people subscribing $50/year.\n",
      "9708. The thing about Apple iiisss. They may not always be the first to release a feature, but at least when they do, it‚Äôs solid. At least they‚Äôre not ashamed of taking their time to make sure a new feature is done well instead of wanting to be the first to do it.

      "9794. Wallpaper app aside.. the one thing that kind of bugs me is that they advertise the 16 as ground up for Apple Intelligence however, the 15 pro are getting all the same features (at least that's what I think). Strip that away and the 16 is probably the smallest IPhone update we've seen in years, probably even smaller than the S style updates we used to get back when. It's sad how hardware upgrades are soon going to be pushed to the back and now AI related features will be the headlining feature. Plus this AI stuff is it really that useful?\n",

Now trying to push a wallpaper app that no one in their right mind should get or needs in a joke !  he's trying to be like Apple thinking people will just buy because its him . Nice try  but no way !\n",
      "9798. I had 11 pro max definitely worth the upgrade was really debatable on 16 pro max specifically having the 120hz  but the 16 is such a step up from my 11 pro max that was barely surviving major difference\n",
      "9799. Kind of weird to be watching an MKBHD review on the phone he‚Äôs reviewing. I pretty much agree with his impressions and conclusion. My XS was kicking the bucket so the 16 Pro is a great upgrade for me. I wanted the nicer screen and cameras, and I didn‚Äôt get it for the promised future features. I do need to play around with the camera more. The camera button is neat but gimmicky. It is good as a quick launch shortcut and a shutter button.\n",

The processor is great, but the computer design itself it pretty mediocre. The 4.5k screen is not as good as you would think, my late 2006  imac's screen genuinely looked better. That was probably the best looking computer screen I've ever seen. It's no longer upgradeable at all, and has far fewer ports. My mind was blown when I realized my 2006 imac and 2006 macbook shared the same RAM, and was easily swapped between them if you wanted to. That's real \"Apple Magic\".\n",

      "Even if this years phone is slightly improved over last years, the apps are the exact same. The cameras are impressive, almost TOO impressive. I'm not a professional photographer or influencer, so why should I care?? Normal people having access to professional quality video tools, is similar to amature p0rn videos that looks professional. It's honestly pretty creepy. Sometimes, less really is more.\n",

Most of the AI on my galaxy s23 is pointless anyway, yea its cool if your the type to just play on your phone with AI photo things, or search circle etc.. but for day to day use not many useful AI features. I hardly use them, and never need them, it's like having a bunch of extra things for no reason at all lol.\n",

      "10090. Why did the wallpaper app charge a subscription?\n",
      "Because they knew you'd keep sticking around for new designs! 50 bucks...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!\n",
      "10091. Apple should have just replaced the power button with camera control button. Easy to use in portrait and landscape. Action button could be doing more things.\n",
      "10092. Sorry bud, that app pricing isn‚Äôt it.\n",
      "10093. You would think after the great success you have found and the support you have received from your viewers would be enough to actually do something for said viewers and give back. But no. Sigh.\n",
      "10094. What weather app are you using in this video?\n",
      "10095. 10:05 just a quick stop here that features of camera control are touchable on screen where I think it‚Äôs optimal to use while using phone as portrait instead of sliding on the button itself.\n",

      "10097. It's AI generated wallpaper for 50 a year üòÇ\n",

      "10106. Can Apple get sued for false marketing as the phone doesn't have any of the AI features?\n",
      "10107. Mark, nobody talk about iphone but wall paper.  iPhone has its own eco system once you are in you are sucked in.  I had stop buying iphone after the customer service hang up my phone when I complained about bugs in their iOS. Time to change?\n",
      "10108. I used to love watching your content, but you‚Äôre just like every other tech YouTuber. All you guys do is complain yes iPhone 16 series is unfinished and Apple deserve criticism for that. You‚Äôve turned into another tech influencer who has let their success go to the head you‚Äôre out of touch with ordinary people and I have more respect for I iJustine than you, she enjoys her products. She could actually review a phone and get enjoyment out of it without complaining, even the comments is just negative. Do you expect Apple to innovate every single year? Do you expect Apple to somehow make big changes in the space of a year? You are the same person that ragged on the Pixel 6a for not having a 90 Hz display despite it low price point when at a time 90 Hz wasn‚Äôt really all that common at that price point I haven‚Äôt never forgiven you for that.\n",
      "10109. What fast charger do you use?\n",

      "10114. We feed you enough couldn‚Äôt of done us a solid and slid us these wallpapers for the free üíÄ\n",
      "10115. I like you but panels being 50$ a year is just greedy especially not having it as just a one time purchase, you make enough money why do you need more, why are you milking your fans\n",
      "10116. So how does the camera button perform with a case? Seems that would render it completely useless other than just a shutter button.\n",
      "10117. This subscription culture has to stop üíÄ\n",
      "10118. It's too greedy of you to launch such a bullsh*t app. Watch two 30 second ads to download a single wallpaper else you have to pay a monthly or yearly amount. Can't believe it\n",
      "10119. I stopped paying attention to the video because the comments here are much more entertaining. He‚Äôs getting roasted üî•\n",

      "10123. I am not paying for your app. Lower the price please.\n",
      "10124. I would like to know what was the thought process apple went through to add the extra button and why the location.\n",
      "10125. I wish I could see the dislike count.\n",
      "10126. So I ordered a 16 pro max. Only because I have a 13 pro max and I kinda feel like it‚Äôs time to update my phone. I have no issues with it honestly. I really didn‚Äôt upgrade for the new AI, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll enjoy it when it goes live. This reminds me of self driving for my Tesla, it‚Äôs not a finished product in my opinion‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs cool to tinker with and I‚Äôll buy a month here and there but I wouldn‚Äôt have spent 8k on it at the time I purchased my car. The iPhone stuff is free and I‚Äôm sure will be cool whenever they figure it out‚Ä¶.\n",
      "10127. I like the videos and the artistic features and creative touches in the video, they are wonderful. But I feel like MKBHD videos are becoming more and more Bland and Generic. Stuff like the elo ratings for the cameras, the dope tech, the IRL testings, for me, had more substance and content value. nothing bad about the video, I just feel like the artistic precision is developing quicker than the essence of the content produced.\n",
      "10128. Yeah bro I aint paying $50 for a wallpaper app that could have more features later. \n",

      "10132. I think the new iphones 17 upwards maybe the 16 are gonna have Touch Id. Proof being the ios 18 update has a privacy feature which of course allows touch id. And I dont think iPhone 8‚Äôs have ios18 right\n",
      "10133. Look at all these apple-barbs/ appleheads trynna bash my guy. 99% of you are not even interested in buying the App. Anyways, APPLE IPHONE 16 SUCKS!!! Apple is not gonna get away with this one.\n",
      "10134. Yeah, this is the moment MKBHD has jumped the shark.  $50 wallpaper app. It‚Äôs like charging $50 for a grocery bag. No one cares and no one is paying that price.\n",
      "10135. I stumbled upon this video ( I‚Äôm not a subscriber ) and I was expecting to watch it but I read the comments about some app he made instead. Lmao! Who pays for darn wallpapers hahah! Come on man.\n",
      "10136. Wow! 99.9% of the comments are about your premium wallpaper app and not the iPhone! High engagement video for a phone which is a dull upgrade over the last phone! Good work MKBHD üòä\n",

      "10142. Greedy app\n",
      "10143. Tech bro MKBHD made an app. Here's my brief panels review for free users. The interface looks pretty alright its very modern with lots of boxes and monotone colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shows off each wallpaper well enough and is easy to navigate. \n",
      "I refused signing in even because why should I to use wallpapers. \n",
      "But I'm sure all that user stuff is usable one moment actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I've seen singing in is mostly so you can save purchases to your account. Moving onto that the prices are actually not that bad. \n",
      "For the art anyways, if you are directly buying art from an artist not bad. I've seen people charge more and some of my friends make stuff so this is not crazy. \n",
      "\n",
      "What is not adding up to me is the subscription. For hd photos and no ads thats still a steep price. And considering we have no idea what is to offer in the future hard pass. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the ads and free user experience it's actually ok.\n",
      "Maybe even good actually two ads is not crazy. We watch ads all the time these days and they're not that intrusive. What does frustrate me is if you watch an add you should get the full image. And I think it should really if possible push it down to 1 ad. I think that'd make it a much better deal for free users.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the artist spilt he says 50% but does not clarify. Is that for everything on the app? Including the direct purchases from the artists. If so thats definitely bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "However if it were a 90/10 spilt where the artists gets 90% for people directly buying their work.\n",
      "And got 50% subscription profits just for their work existing there.\n",
      "That'd be a pretty significant and really well paid thing going on.\n",
      "As things stand for though this is not the case. Maybe it's something similar I would really hope. But as things are right now I have my worries. \n",
      "\n",
      "So whats my take? its a perfectly usable wallpaper app. The ads are fine and the art looks good. The user experience is acceptable and the app while basic is easy to use. \n",
      "So it's just an ok product being pushed by a big Youtuber thats the end of the app review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me end this comment by saying the subscription sucks. And so does the artists pay most likely. \n",
      "My hot take is stop criticizing the app itself. Its fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We really need to drive home the real issues, which is firstly the artists pay that needs to be clarified and fixed. Then how awful value the subscription actually is. While yes not a scam it's disappointing. These are the biggest things we need to make clear. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is some random viewer and singing off, bye bye.\n",

      "10159. No one cares about his obvious factual error about fast changing? The phones can only charge at 30w, although it can pull more power if you use the phone while charging, but the battery only receives 30w. When you publish your review after everyone else has, there's no excuse making such an mistake\n",

      "10161. Big fan in general but didn‚Äôt he just say the other day he doesn‚Äôt recommend investing in tech based on promise of future features??? Now we supposed to subscribe to the wallpaper app because more stuff is coming???\n",
      "10162. i REALLY dislike this camera control button. in my opinion, they should have never created it nor turned the ring switch into an action button. instead, just removed it. the fewer buttons and holes in a phone the better.\n",

The iPhone 16s are not any more incremental than any of the last 4 years of phones, it‚Äôs just that people can‚Äôt help but focus on what they DON‚ÄôT have. Again, that‚Äôs all on Apple for selling phones based on features that literally don‚Äôt exist yet. But I‚Äôll tell you this, I went from an iPhone 11 Pro to an iPhone 14 Pro Max a couple years ago. I just went from the 14 Pro Max to a 16 Pro Max - the jump from the 14 to the 16 genuinely feels a lot bigger than the difference from the 11 to the 14. The physical design jump from 11 to 14 was the biggest difference - but frankly it got worse. The iPhone 14 Pro Max was way less comfortable to hold. Moving to USB-C, the Action Button, Camera Control, the far superior physical design and comfort, the 5x telephoto - these are all huge improvements over the 14 Pro Max. The iPhone 14 Pro Max looked a lot newer than the 11 Pro, but the actual day-to-day use was barely different with the exception of the generally better cameras.\n",

      "\n",
      "When did iPhones had 45W Charging & 30W Wireless Charging? Where they were onpar on Flagship Android phone. Fucking Finally. \n",
      "2 hours & 30 mins more Battery life than the previous version for screentime.\n",
      "When did the recent iPhone was bigger than the Samsung Ultra series? \n",
      "Camera Control can be super handy for a sudden quick shot, when you want to take a photo real fast and getting it from your pocket \n",
      "and has a proper color edit inside the phone like those awesome Fuji X100 series. \n",
      "AI Integration (when it comes, it can be handy to rewrite email without going to ChatGPT, yes I use AI daily on refining the emails) \n",
      "\n",
      "Those are just some massive hardware upgrades, iPhone 15 and the previous versions didn't had a huge jump, specially with the charging speed. The previous version was like what, 20W? 25W? Charging? \n",
      "\n",
      "I could be wrong, but some people just say it's a very incremental upgrade just to cope & not upgrade this generation. So do you have to upgrade when there's a massive upgrade  on phones ? Up to you, if your budget allows you then why not? A flagship phone can last you a good 5-7 years. But to say it's not massive compared to the outgoing model is just insane.\n",
      "10729. great intro by the way\n",
      "10730. The also have a newly rearchitected SoC which is faster and more energy efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "The iPhones handle spacial audio, are better at thermal management, and have hardware ray tracing so games should play a lot better (and longer without screen dimming).\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the plain old non-pro 16s should be able to play the AAA games that last year required the iPhone 15 Pro models.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, buy it for what it is today, or wait for features to drop which make it worthwhile to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought a 16 Pro Max and expect to see some _fantastic_ easter eggs to drop throughout the coming year.\n",
      "10731. $50 a year?! You‚Äôve been rich too long and aren‚Äôt in touch with reality üòÇ especially the year AI generated wallpapers launch. No go my friend.\n",
      "10732. Buy iPhone 16 pro max for the battery.\n",
      "10733. Thanks for the honest review and recommendations. Great perspective!\n",
      "10734. Ok you told us the wallpaper now tell us what weather app that is\n",
      "10735. Na man y'all just came here to clown on an ad placement üòÇ\n",
      "10736. All I can think of with the wallpaper thing is just, do a month, download what ya want, unsubscribe. I‚Äôm all for helping artists but 12 bucks a month or 50 a year is wild, I‚Äôd rather just commission an artist\n",
      "Or just, find wallpapers elsewhere\n",
      "10737. I wanted to use the app cos of Mkbhd but $50 a year for a wallpaper app is insane!\n",
      "10738. What case would you genuinely recommend for the base iphone?\n",
      "10739. MKBHD thought he was untouchable and released a quick cash grab on the video that will get the most views.\n",
      "10740. apple will get rid of the camera button in 2 or 3 generations and will sell you as the greatest innovation ever.\n",
      "10741. This is apple strategy in it's own way, so every brand schedules two major product launches but Apple still has it's yearly cycle for the next upgrade, but if they want to remain in the loop of hype, they're doing this on purpose so that people keep talking about new iPhones for a while. Bcoz the moment they push it, folks will review Gemini vs App Int.\n",
      "10742. ü§îIf apple gets away with this. Every phone going forward will be shipped half assed!ü´§\n",
      "10743. Honestly because of those flares at low light conditions, it makes the camera in such scenarios unreliable, the goodness of its sensor will completely be overshadowed by such a miss from Apple. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth mentioning too the anti-reflective technology that Samsung incorporated on its flagship phone yet Apple has failed to do such. Having a screen that does not reflect your surroundings will make it so the phone does not need to abuse the brightness so much in really needed situations, this way, increasing the durability of the display, the battery and keeping the temperatures of the phone lower. Overall it will optimize the health of the iPhone in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been a popular topic that the smartphone market has matured, some companies should just accept the fact and focus on perfecting the main underlying issues that specially everyone talks about until they can actually come up with innovative breakthroughs. Even more when the company begins to rely on techniques like the promise of a future feature and update to the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple should stop being conservative with their battery sizes and take big leaps in their capacity, taking advantage of their Software optimization the iPhone‚Äôs improvements will be stellar. In the not so long future we will likely be moving to different materials for them that will pack more energy density per space. I get the feeling the quality of the current batteries have decreased because older phones used to have a slower degradation rate, while now newer phones with fewer cycles have a decay that is way faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list could go on and on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The details make the bigger differences!\n",

      "10745. First World Influencers are so out of touch with reality it‚Äôs insane.\n",
      "10746. People got that kind of money\n",
      "10747. 19:01 I am literally doing as you say before you even say it. Base model 13 with 128 gigs has been fine, but has started to show its limited usage. Still a fantastic phone, but I have larger hands and a need for more storage for the things I do in my day to day life. The 16 will be a big upgrade for me not only in the game department, but also in being a phone. The battery on my phone has been sagging a lot lately, even on power saving mode, and I am in need of a bigger phone, with a bigger battery\n",
      "10748. Wallpaper app: Barely reviewable üòÇ\n",
      "10749. It is confirmed that some technology reviewers are criticizing a global brand by using scripted words. They are implying that the brand's lack of success is due to not following certain steps. However, when it comes to their own products, they are attempting to emulate the brand in order to create a sense of premium quality  \"For just a wallaper that we can download in full hd from browser\" Should have gone with techburners idea when launching wallpaper app\n",
      "10750. Rabbit M1 should review Marques new Panels app\n",
      "10751. I see Marques is working on his relations with Canada with that shirt...since he took away Canada's gold medal in ultimate frisbee.\n",

      "10764. Got a spare 16 pro max? ill test my AU speeds\n",
      "10765. Honestly what would‚Äôve been wrong with Apple just shipping the new phones in like November? Like have the reveal event but just wait to ship it? Why the hurry?\n",
      "10766. Honestly‚Ä¶ I like the purple color. I want it I‚Äôm gonna get it.\n",

      "10769. Thats a expensive subscription‚Ä¶. Love ur videos btw\n",
      "10770. It‚Äôs crazy to not even put the rainbows when you talk to Siri that shit is not hard you don‚Äôt even have to have ai just make it light up to make people feel special\n",
      "10771. Didn't you recommend that apple put these extra buttons on there phones in an old HTC review?\n",
      "10772. I‚Äôd rather pay an artist $50 for a custom wallpaper dude.\n",
      "10773. Why does panels need to track my location? It harvests so much user data it‚Äôs not funny\n",
      "10774. Who spends money on wallpapers?  Let alone needs an app for them?\n",
      "10775. I have a 15 but I‚Äôm buying a 16 because I want the new Teal color and I need the 256gb of storage. My 128gb is full.\n",
      "10776. You bugging. This panels app is wild.\n",
      "10777. So what you're saying, iPhone 16 is not worth? The squeeze is not worth buying and that I should just keep my 15 okay, gotcha, that was the plan. Anyway, hopefully they will be at least smart enough.\n",

      "10780. ill wait for the iphone 20\n",
      "10781. Bro I didn't expect this comment section to be filled with the wallpaper app hate ü§£ü§£. And many of them aren't wrong. Who pays for wallpapers?\n",
      "10782. $50 for wallpaper!? Lfmao bro\n",
      "10783. Who pays 50 bucks for wallpaper üòÇ\n",

      "10784. I feel like you stabbed me in the back with 50 dollars per year subscription üòÆ this is ao sad to see you go for money\n",

      "10786. Genuinely curious what a  smart phone needs 8k 30fps for tho? I thought there are barely any 8k screens out there\n",
      "10787. The price is crazy\n",
      "10788. It‚Äôs because AI is being born to you. Specific to your AI to begin with based on your profile as a user. Just my guess.\n",
      "10789. Apple spends all its money on marketing as well, and also refining the hardware to its max. As everything is in house at Apple, it would make sense for it to be this incremental of an upgrade. Really excited for the AI stuff though ‚Ä¶\n",
      "10790. Bro thought he could get away with making his fanbase pay $50/year for a WALLPAPER app üíÄüíÄüíÄ who does he take us for\n",
      "10791. MKBHD might be getting dragged for the wallpaper app, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is yet another softball review for the Iphone. It's a poor product, but MKBHD won't say it because he's been partnering with Apple for some time now.\n",
      "10792. To take pictures and open camera you can also do with action button. Why we need extra button to do same thing? Cant they just put sensor on action button ??\n",
      "10793. I actually bought the pro Max in hopes they don‚Äôt ever come out with apple intelligence\n",
      "10794. Get the Vivo X100 Ultra if you have the access for it guys. The iPhone it's not worth it anymore. Well probably until 17 or 18 series.\n",
      "10795. Money money money money\n",
      "10796. This is honestly sad. If you're someone who loves apple you should be atleast a little disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand Apple prides itself on performance meaning if they release something its gonna work as intended and really well but man they released the phone without all the promised features? Now what if they release the new features and they aren't like you imagined?\n",

      "10800. the worst part of the app is actually the few weirdos that are defending it in the comments, w the same sad argument\n",
      "10801. People just like to get scammed nowadays bro\n",

      "10808. So boring to hear you whining for everything\n",
      "10809. The wallpaper app is a complete joke on a comical scale. 50 dollars for a wallpaper app should be a crime. If you absolutely have to have a subscription 1 dollar a month and 8 dollar a year and like 20 dollars for lifetime license. Everyone should just use backdrops. I have been watching you for years and its sad to see you do something so out of touch from yoir audience.\n",

      "10814. Hey Marques, I was really excited to use your app, but no.1: The app doesn't even work in Syria, I have to use a VPN, which I can't be bothered to do for a wallpaper app\n",
      "No.2: You need to watch 2 ads to get a wallpaper every time, which is something all other wallpaper apps I've used don't force you to do.\n",
      "10815. Ground up? LmaoüòÇ ok\n",
      "10816. Seriously every comments is about the app but not the actual content of the video\n",

      "10818. Man everybody‚Äôs talking about the wallpaper app and not the actual video that is wild\n",
      "10819. 18:54 I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max (in Sierra Blue because it‚Äôs the best color Apple has ever shipped) and I have now decided that I will get one of the 16 pluses (maybe in white or pink) because of this review. I have had pro motion on this 13 pro max disabled for two days now and I have not been any less happy with the screen. To me pro motion is not worth the multi hundred dollar upgrade and the cameras are functionally the same for when I need to record a concert or snap a picture at a graduation ceremony. What used to hold me back was the screen size but now the 16 plus is as big as my 13 pro max. Battery should be fine for what I need unless there is a battery-gate when Apple Intelligence releases. \n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially this is me thanking you for making a reliable, sensible, UNBIASED review that I can actually functionally use to make financial purchases on Apple products. Thank you to MKBHD but also to everyone who works with him to make these videos. ‚ù§Ô∏èüì±\n",

      "10823. i came to tell you that your wallpaper app is much too expensive for a subscription but it looks like i don't really have to\n",
      "10824. Happily sticking with my 15 Pro Max! It's great and I'm digging the 18.1 public beta performance. Don't really care about Apple Intelligence honestly.\n",
      "10825. honestly, this is the best the base phone has looked since they introduced the pro models!\n",
      "10826. Lets be real. 2 year from now iphone 15 will get all the AIA  gimmicks as well\n",

      "10831. To everyone commenting 50/yr is expensive, it's honestly about par with the other wallpaper app subscriptions that I've seen, albeit like 10 dollars pricier if you pay yearly. The monthly price is honestly about the same as competitors as it chalks up to 4.17 ish a month, though it's lacking one major component: themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the only way to get the most bang for buck on this app is if it also have some great themes and widget customizatios. I don't see this having a huge market on android but IOS definitely is lacking in this department.\n",

The past 5-10yrs or so years we've been seeing almost every major game be released feeling like its unfinished and over time they start polishing the product (i.e No Mans Sky, Cyberpunk). Now with Apple releasing without its AI, Pixel releasing without Android 15. Are we going to start seeing unfinished yearly phones? Hell, are Phones going to go down like an EA or Ubisoft route where, the new AI models will be locked behind a paywall and you're stuck with last years Pixel camera software because you don't want to pay the however much money it may cost to get new software?

Yet, those same people will put out a wallpaper app.  To me tech reviewers, or some of them, have got their roles confused.  Commenting on products has become a full time gig.  With that comes the loss of objectivity and the need to have something to say. The need to be different.  They create nothing.  It‚Äôs a job of opportunity. They gain power through the perception that they can be the conduit between a product and the people who buy said product.  Ego centrism distorts the reality of what their role really is.  The wall paper app, and he‚Äôs not the only one, reveals another opportunity in a revealing way.  \n",

Plus, apple's marketing definitely makes a huge point about it and you could probably argue that the average consumer would expect it to have the feature if they're advertising it so much without an explicit \"coming soon\" disclaimer.

Subscription for a wallpaper app is mental. I will stick with my clean gradient. Again, I appreciate supporting artists, but I'm not rich enough enough to support artists.\n",

In addition U Tube are pestering me and my friends and other viewer's to subscribe to the add free Premium at a cost of $33.00 a month. That is separate to the Author's own sponsor's. This one is 20 minutes long . I am sorry but I have to delete it , unseen , even though it sounds interesting. The times are a changing and U Tube have got far too greedy and as with FB/ Meta , I am tapping out. Sorry about that, but it's doing my head in and U Tube is no longer fun as is Meta with it's tripe. I added ad blocker's but that didn't help. Thanks for all the previous videos and U Tube's MKBHD but corporate greed and bombardment of advertisments and having GOOGLE/U Tube unmercilly put their foot on poor people's throat's for money or being bashed senseless with advertisment's is tandamount to smugness and stupidity on their part. They have destroyed their own cash cow in My Humble Opinion. I hope you understand. Peace Out, buddy. 23 September 2024. ¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨Rule number 1, do not kill off your audience .

Also just on the side, you mention that you review products based on what they are today vs what the manufacturer promises in the future, but you said your app is unfinished with more things to come? I'm guessing since iPhone review videos get the most views you needed to get this app out the door in time for the review or something. Anyway, gl and all that.\n",

I wouldn‚Äôt even pay a one time fee of that much for wallpaper and I think most people wouldn‚Äôt either but I think by having it at 50 bucks and then all of a sudden drop it to a one time fee on sale for $10. Everyone will go rushing.

But you know it I know it and everyone else knows it what the problem has become. And that is our phones getting damaged through software updates. We buy a phone today, for couple of years, no problem whatsoever. However maybe 2 to 3 years down the line, green line appears after software updates. There are numerous videos regarding these issue by fairly well known youtubers. MKBHD, its our heartiest request to you that you make a video on this, because these phone companies are straight up scamming us by damaging our phones through software updates and forcing us to buy phones every 2 to 3 years. That is the more important topic to talk about than talking about than the new phone has better dynamic range. Hardly anyone cares about slightly better dynamic range, but people are suffering due to these green line and other issues that appear on phone through software updates after 2 to 3 years. PLEASE.

In fact apart from an extra 2mm length wise, they are both the same size despite the 16 Pro having a bigger display, thanks to the bezels.

      "11697. Why not just tell us where you got the wallpapers instead of making it an app? The next thing I wanna point out you used to not be so negative. Like you use a lot of red cameras, but I didn‚Äôt see you be that harsh and negative towards the red hydrogen one that was a complete flop. Apple‚Äôs doing things differently. They‚Äôre on device learning an AI is not ready, especially when it comes to integrating with ChatGBT but I feel like once everything is fully launched it will be worth the wait. Everybody cares about pro motion it‚Äôs like the expectation is to make pro features available for everybody at a lower cost and that‚Äôs just not how business works.\n",
      "11698. Lmao what an insanely lame app\n",
      "11699. An app that you subscribe to for content you can get for free anywhere on the internet, thats a hard pass for me.  While i know the subscription model isn't going away i actually hate that its promoting the illusion of actually owning anything when you are really just paying for access. I also feel this would be trying to do what zedge is doing and if that's the case it definitely not worth it with Android phones. ( Not trying to hate or anything but rather express my point of view, all the best with the venture though ‚úåüèæ)\n",

      "11762. Am I going to pay $50 a year for the wallpapers app? Nope. But wallpapers aren‚Äôt my thing anyway. I have nothing against creators expanding into other businesses, though. If they see sufficient people buying it at the current price, then great! If not, they‚Äôll either alter their offerings or pricing (or both). Very few (if any) businesses get it right on the first go, so it‚Äôll be interesting to see where this goes.\n",

      "11764. yeah.... not buying wallpaper amigo\n",
      "11765. I disabled the camera adjustments on the camera control button in accessibility. I use it as just a camera opening and shutter button and I dig it. With the full features on I would change settings just trying to take a shot and was over it.\n",
      "11766. The phone does not support 45W wired charging.  Highest it hits is 31W on my ProMax‚Ä¶.and only up until 45% charge and then it starts slowing down.\n",

My iPhone 15 pro max battery was truly garbage.. worst iPhone battery I had in a while, I would get roughly 4-5 hours of screen time, it would get hot just doing something as simple as watching YouTube, and 10 months in at 350 charge cycles I was at 88 percent efficiency.. new 16 pro max I‚Äôm getting 10+ hours of screen time easy and it‚Äôs not getting hot nearly as often.\n",

      "11799. Just upgraded from the 14 Pro to the 16 Pro Max, and honestly, the only things that jump out at me are the bigger screen and USB-C. As for the new \"Camera Control\" feature?

      "11805. My hot take as someone who has an iPhone 16 is i wish they had made taking a photo be a soft press and changing settings be a hard press because the hard press will almost ALWAYS make my photo blurrier from how hard I have to press.

      "11822. Hot take:I think Apple should release a new phone every 5 years so the phones would be drastically distinguishable in innovations rather than something being 2x better than the previous looking like a visual fluctuation in development as the phone‚Äôs history of releases accumulates\n",

The main thing I want is to be able to tone down the over sharpening.

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. Focus on Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The high mention of the camera suggests that it is a central element of the video, indicating that the camera capabilities of the iPhone 16 are a major draw for viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reference to the term \"pro\" indicates that there are discussions around the Pro model, suggesting an interest in its advanced features and improvements over previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The mention of the \"button\" suggests a discussion about the new \"Action button,\" which has replaced the ring-silent switch, offering more customization options, potentially enhancing the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Target Audience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The keywords indicate that the video is aimed at tech enthusiasts or potential buyers interested in the latest features and specifications of the iPhone 16, particularly those looking for enhancements in photography and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mostly Positive Perception:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The results reflect a mostly positive perception of the iPhone 16, with 44% positive comments compared to 26% negative comments. This indicates that, overall, the audience is excited about the launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Positive Reception:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The majority of comments (5,240) are of a positive tone, which suggests that the general public is satisfied with the improvements and features of the iPhone 16, such as design, camera, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Neutral Interest and Curiosity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- With 3,573 neutral comments, there is considerable interest from users seeking information or comparisons, which is typical in product launch videos where consumers want to understand more before making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Criticisms and Doubts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 3,102 negative comments suggest areas of dissatisfaction that may include pricing, lack of significant changes, issues with specific features, or unfavorable comparisons with previous models or competing brands. This could be a point of focus for Apple‚Äôs development and marketing teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for Marketing and Product Development:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marketing Strategy: Given the overall positive perception and the focus on camera features and the new button, marketing campaigns could center around these elements to attract photography and tech enthusiasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Future Improvements: Feedback from negative comments could guide Apple in identifying areas for improvement in future models or updates, especially regarding consumer expectations around pricing and significant product changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sentiment analysis reveals general enthusiasm for the iPhone 16, but also highlights the importance of addressing user criticisms and concerns. This not only helps Apple improve its product but also strengthens customer loyalty by demonstrating that it values user feedback."
