# The wellknown Titanic Dataset

This dataset is one of the most famous datasets as a kickstart for python beginners.
I had to clean the dataset and answer the following questions:
- What is the survival and death rate?
- What is the survival rate by gender?
- What is the survival rate by class?
- What was the average Titanic ticket price?
- What was the name of the oldest passenger, did he or she survived?
- List the name of the babies on board, did all of them survived?
